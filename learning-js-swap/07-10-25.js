//while loop
// The while loop is used when the number of iterations is not known beforehand and depends on a certain condition.
// The loop continues as long as the condition is true.

//nested for loop
// A nested for loop is a loop inside another loop. The inner loop runs completely for each iteration of the outer loop.
